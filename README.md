## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ibrahimsql/pyrecon.git
  

2. Navigate to the project directory:
 cd pygoogledork
3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
  
## **How to Use**

To run **PyRecon**, simply execute the following command with your desired search parameters:

python PyRecon -d "<dork_query>" -t <threads> -o output.json


### Example:

python PyRecon -d "inurl:admin site:example.com" -t 4 -o results.json


This will run the query `inurl:admin site:example.com` using **4 threads**, saving the results in a file called **results.json**.

### Available Options:

-h, --help: Show help message and exit.

-q QUERY [QUERY ...], --query QUERY [QUERY ...]: Google Dork query or queries (multiple allowed).

-n NUMBER, --number NUMBER: Max number of sites to fetch.

-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT: Output file name (without extension).

-t TLD, --tld TLD: Domain extension (e.g., com, org, net).

--remove-www: Remove www prefix from URLs.

--min-delay MIN_DELAY: Minimum wait time (in seconds) between queries.

--max-delay MAX_DELAY: Maximum wait time (in seconds) between queries.

--output-format {txt,json,csv,db}: Output format (default: "txt", supports .txt, .json, .csv, or .db).

--proxy PROXY [PROXY ...]: Proxy addresses to route queries through (e.g., http://proxy1, http://proxy2).

--check-cloudflare: Skip sites that are protected by Cloudflare.

--threads THREADS: Max number of threads to run concurrently.

--proxy-rotator: Use a different proxy for each request to avoid IP bans.

--captcha-bypass: Attempt to bypass CAPTCHA challenges during searches.

--scheduler SCHEDULER: Schedule scan to start at a specific time (e.g., '23:00').

--max-results MAX_RESULTS: Limit the max number of results to be returned.

--vulnerability-report: Automatically generate vulnerability reports based on findings.

--web-scraping-api: Integrate with a web scraping API for enhanced scraping capabilities.

--lang LANG: Filter search results by a specific language (e.g., 'en', 'tr').

--geo-target GEO_TARGET: Specify a geographic location for search queries (e.g., 'US', 'DE').

--dns-tunneling: Bypass network restrictions using DNS Tunneling methods.

--ssl-check: Perform SSL/TLS vulnerability checks on the discovered domains.

--dork-type {filetype,inurl,intitle}: Specify the dork type (e.g., filetype, inurl, intitle).

--category CATEGORY: Choose a category for the search query (e.g., 'admin', 'login').
